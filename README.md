# EM FRENTE

A flutter app that helps you maintain progress by tracking how many days you are able to do a task.

My objective with this project is to practice flutter and, most importantly, build something useful. I believe that the best way to improve at something is by making it a habit, the purpose of this app is to help visualize how much you are dedicating to a task each day and thus make it easier to set priorities.  
It is still a long way ahead until I have the app I plan this to be, but, little by little, I'll get there.
